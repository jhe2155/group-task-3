# Group-task-3

We wanted to compare CO2 emissions in correlation to car-population within the United States. To compare the two, we looked at data recorded in 2018

Here is the data we used:
[Emissions Data Source](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/)

[Automobile Registration Source](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2018/mv1.cfm)

These two graphs show a direct and intuitive correlation between the number of registered cars per state with the state's carbon dioxide emissions. The cholopleth graph allows for an easy visualization, and the order of the values for the color schemes match for each graph. This makes analysis of the data shown much more accurate and easier to interpret.
